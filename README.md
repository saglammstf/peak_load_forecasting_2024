Instantaneous Electricity Peak Load Forecasting Using Optimization and Machine Learning

This study aims to enhance the accuracy of instantaneous peak load forecasting by employing models incorporating various optimization and machine learning (ML) methods. This study examines the impact of independent inputs on peak load estimation through various combinations and subsets using multilinear regression (MLR) equations. This research utilizes input data from 1980 to 2020, including import and export data, population, and gross domestic product (GDP), to forecast the instantaneous electricity peak load as the output value. The effectiveness of these techniques is evaluated based on error metrics, including mean absolute error (MAE), mean square error (MSE), mean absolute percentage error (MAPE), root mean square error (RMSE), and R2. The comparison extends to popular optimization methods, such as particle swarm optimization (PSO), and the newest method in the field, including dandelion optimizer (DO) and gold rush optimizer (GRO). This comparison is made against conventional machine learning methods, such as support vector regression (SVR) and artificial neural networks (ANN), in terms of their prediction accuracy. 

Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO), Gold Rush Optimization (GRO), and Dandelion Optimization (DO) algorithm codes used in this study were modified from the codes developed by Erdemci 2023; Zolfi et al., 2023 and Zhao et al., 2022; respectively, for peak load future forecasting.
